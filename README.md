# Instagram Bot
A repo for this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFO39BDS4X9EphKSqT0JIytRNHaHB9Y0o).
This is an instagram posts scheduler. It scrapes images from Reddit and posts them to Instagram. Made just for fun!

## Prerequisites
You need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

## Setup
- Clone this repo.
- Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` file and update the values.
- Do `npm install`
- You would also need to expose the locally hosted application using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). And then set the webhook for the Telegram bot to the URL that is given by ngrok. Check the video on how to set it up.
- Simply run `node bin/www` in project root.

## Issues
Feel free to create new issues if you see any problem with the code. I would be happy to fix them.
